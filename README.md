# Image Carousel Implementation

This is a prototype of a button-controlled image carousel. Unlike many tutorials out there, it doesn't come with bloated styles or complex code. It's meant to be tweaked and extended by the developer based on current implementation needs.

Since the code is simple and easy to follow (less than 20 lines of JavaScript), new features can be added without  difficulty.
